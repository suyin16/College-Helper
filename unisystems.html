                            <p>CUNY and SUNY are separate and independent university systems, although both are public institutions that receive funding from New York State. CUNY, however, is additionally funded by the City of New York.

                            <h4>University vs. College</h4>
                            <p>A "university" is a group of schools for studies after high school (also referred to as secondary school). At least one of these schools is a college where students receive a bachelor's degree. The other schools in a university are"graduate" (also known as "postgraduate") schools where students receive advanced degrees. Therefore, a university offers both the bachelor's degree and graduate degrees such as the master's (M.A.) and doctorate (Ph.D.).
You can earn a bachelor's degree at either a college or a university.
Some colleges are part of a university and are located on the university campus. (The "campus" is the school buildings and surrounding area). A few colleges offer graduate programs in selected subjects. However, it is usually universities that offer graduate programs.

                            <h4>Public vs. Private</h4>
                            <p>The major difference between public universities and private colleges lies in how they are funded. Today, state governments pay for most of the cost of operating public universities. They also oversee these institutions through appointed boards and trustees. This influx of public money is why tuition is lower at a public university. The real cost of an attendance is subsidized. Money raised from tuition doesn't need to cover all of a public college's expenses, such as paying faculty.
Meanwhile, private colleges don't receive funds from state legislatures. They rely heavily on tuition and private contributions. This means tuition rates are generally higher.
