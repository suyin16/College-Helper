                            <h4>General Questions</h4>
                            <p>Is the food good? How safe is the campus? How culturally diverse do you want the college or university to be? One
                            way to answer these questions is by visiting the colleges that you are interested in because you get a sense of how the college is like culturally, socially, and academically.
                             <!-- Also, when you visit colleges, you gain a better understanding of what you want in a college and what you don't want in a college.</p> -->

                            <p>Does the college have the majors that you want to study? Or if you don't know what
                              exact career you would like to pursue, you should check if the college enables you to choose your major in your sophomore or junior year.</p>

                            <p>This is an important question, if you are boarding because you want to make sure that you won't get bored.
                              Do they have clubs that you would want to be a part of? If they donâ€™t, it could be an opportunity to take initiative
                              and create your own club. (It can be a daunting task, but it would demonstrate leadership)</p>

                            <p>And of course you also want to keep in mind location. Are you comfortable boarding at a school that is far away from home? Or do you prefer just commuting from your house to the school?
